\documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}
% Some Computer Society conferences also require the compsoc mode option,
% but others use the standard conference format.
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[conference]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

% Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column
% - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also,
% in-text middle ("here") positioning is typically not used, but it
% is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but
% not Computer Society journals). Most IEEE journals/conferences use
% top floats exclusively. 
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the
% \fnbelowfloat command of the stfloats package.
\section{PHASE 1: SHAKE MY BOUNDARY}
% no \IEEEPARstart
In this section we perform boundary detection using a method called "PB-Lite". The outline of the process if shown in the figure below:
%\begin{figure}
%\includegraphics[scale=1]{outline.png}
%\caption{Overview of the PB-Lite}
%\end{figure}
\\
The first step in this process is to filter the image and find a texton map which is essentially the texture map of the image. This is computed by clustering the filter responses with K-Means clustering.\\

Filtering is used to access the low level features in the image. This helps us to measure and aggregate the regional texture, brightness and color properties. Different scales and orientations of a particular filter are used so that various types of textures can be addressed. Here, we have used three filter banks namely: Oriented DoG filters, Leung-Malik Filters and Gabor Filters. 
 
\subsection{Oriented DoG Filters}
The Oriented Difference of Gaussian Filter is generated by taking the difference of two normal Gaussian Filters with same variance but the centers are of each is shifted by an amount equal to the standard deviation. This filter can also be created by convolving a simple Sobel Filter and a Gaussian kernel. The figure below shows the gaussian filter bank used for generating the results shown in the future sections.\\
%\begin{figure}
%\includegraphics[scale=1]{DoG.png}
%\caption{DoG Filter Bank}
%\end{figure}

The filter bank is generated by using 3 different scale values and 15 orientations for each scale, linearly-spaced from $0\deg$ to $360\deg$. Hence, the total number of filters is $3*15$ = $45$.

\subsection{Leung-Malik Filters}
The Leung-Malik filter bank is a collection 48 filters with multiple scales and orientations. It consists of first and second order derivatives of Gaussians, Laplacian of Gaussian(LOG) filters and 4 Gaussian filters. All these filters account for different types of features in the image. The filter bank is shown in the figure below:\\
%\begin{figure}
%\includegraphics[scale=1]{LM.png}
%\caption{LM filter bank}
%\end{figure}

\subsection{Gabor Filters}
Gabor filters are inspired based on the way human visual system. A Gabor filter is generated by modulating a gaussian kernel with a sinusoidal plane wave. This is a linear filter that basically analyses if there is any specific frequency(governed by $\lambda$) content in the image in specific directions around the point of interest. The Gabor filterbank used in this project is shown in the figure below:
%\begin{figure}
%\includegraphics[scale=1]{Gabor.png}
%\caption{Gabor filter bank}
%\end{figure}
The filter bank with is generated for $\lambda$=1 with three scales:[9,16,25]. Also, for each scale value, 15 filters with different orientations, uniformly spaced from 0 to 360 degrees are generated.

\subsection{Texton Map $\mathcal{T}$}
Once the filtering process of the image is complete, we end up with a stack of images of size $ m \times n \times N$, where $m,n$ are the dimensions of the image and $N$ is the total number of filters used. Thus, each pixel value can now be represented as a distribution of these $N$ values. Each distribution is then represented by a unique Texton-ID. These different distributions for all the pixels are then clustered into $K$ textons using K-Means. This generates an image which captures the texture changes in the original image and can be seen below:
%\begin{figure}
%\includegraphics[scale=1]{Texton.png}
%\caption{Texton Map}
%\end{figure}
\subsection{Brightness Map $\mathcal{B}$}
The Brightness map captures the changes in intensity of light in the image. Similar to Texton map generation the K-Means clustering of the grayscale image is performed for $K$=16 and the output can be seen below:
%\begin{figure}
%\includegraphics[scale=1]{Brightness.png}
%\caption{Brightness Map}
%\end{figure}

\subsection{Color Map $\mathcal{C}$}
The Color map captures the changes in color/ chrominance in the image. The color values were clustered using K-Means clustering into 16 clusters. This generates an output image which can be seen below:
%\begin{figure}
%\includegraphics[scale=1]{Color.png}
%\caption{Color Map}
%\end{figure}

\subsection{Gradient Maps}
The Maps generated above are used to calculate gradient maps $\mathcal{T_g}$,$\mathcal{B_g}$ and $\mathcal{C_g}$. These maps encode the texture, brightness and color distributions changing at each pixel. These are generated by comparing the values at each pixel by convolving the image with a left/right half-disc pair centered at the pixel. The basic concept behind this is that if the values are similar the gradient should be small and if the values are dissimilar, the gradient will be large.\\

The half-disks are generated by multiplying an array of size equal to the radius/scale of the circular disk with all values which lie inside this radius equal to 1 and rest 0, with an array of equal size but where one half of the array is 0s and the other half consists of 1s. This multiplication results in a half-disk which can be rotated to produce the desired half-disk mask.\\

Here if you rotate the disk after you've multiplied the two arrays will result in pixel voids. This can be avoided by rotating the rectangular block matrix of 0s and 1s and then by applying a "logical OR" operator on them. This gives the required half-disk masks which are shown below:

%\begin{figure}
%\includegraphics[scale=1]{Half-Disk.png}
%\caption{Half-Disk Masks for scales=[]}
%\end{figure} 

Using the above generated Half-Disk masks we compute the $\mathcal{T_g}, \mathcal{B_g}$ and $\mathcal{C_g}$ maps by comparing the distributions generated using each half-disk pair with a $\chi^2$ measure. The binning scheme is defined for $\mathcal{K}$ indexes which is equal to the number of K-Means clusters for each $mathcal{T}, mathcal{B},mathcal{C}$. This procedure is repeated for all the half-disk pairs to generate a 3D matrix of size $m \times n \times N$ where $m,n$ are the dimensions of the image and $N$ is the number of filters.\\

The output of the mean of each $\mathcal{T_g}, \mathcal{B_g}$ and $\mathcal{C_g}$ is given as follows:
%\begin{figure}
%\includegraphics[scale=1]{Tg.png}
%\caption{$\mathcal{T_g}$}
%\end{figure}
%\begin{figure}
%\includegraphics[scale=1]{Tg.png}
%\caption{$\mathcal{B_g}$}
%\end{figure}\begin{figure}
%\includegraphics[scale=1]{Tg.png}
%\caption{$\mathcal{C_g}$}
%\end{figure}


\subsection{PB-Lite Output}
Finally, the gradient maps generated are combined with Canny and Sobel baselines using the equation:
\begin{equation}
PbEdges = \frac{(\mathcal{T_g}+\mathcal{B_g}+\mathcal{C_g})}{3}\odot (w_1 * cannyPb + w_2 * sobelPb)
\end{equation}
The $\odot$ is the Hadamard operator which is the element-wise multiplicatin of the arrays in the equation. The choice of the weights $w_1$ and $w_2$ is based on the canny and sobel baselines and the features we want from each baseline. The only constraint is that $w_1+w_2$ = $1$. The Canny and Sobel outputs and the resulting Pb-lite outputs are shown in the figures below:
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[height=6, width=8]{canny.png}
%\includegraphics[scale=1]{sobel.png}
%\includegraphics[scale=1]{pblite.png}
\caption{(a)Canny Baseline, (b)Sobel Baseline (c)Pb-lite output}
